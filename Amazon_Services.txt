Apache Web server:
Will create an EC2 instance for the web server and will install apache there.  

Apache Tomcat server:
Will create EC2 instance for the apache tomcat server and will install tomcat in that. We can also install docker in that instance and can create container with installed tomcat.

Active MQ: 
Will use SQS service for this because of guarantee of receiving messages atleast once and smooth integration with other hosted application and services.

Oracle:
Will use Amazon RDS because of easy setup, operate and ease of deployment in the cloud. Amazon RDS manages backup and monitoring activites 

HA and Load balancing:
For load balancing we can create EC2 instances with choosing the application load balancer. Application load balancer is having feature of high availability as we can specify the availability zone.
